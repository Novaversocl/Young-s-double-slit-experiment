Young's double-slit experiment-Experimento de la doble rendija de Young

The Young's double-slit experiment involves passing light through two closely spaced slits and observing the resulting pattern on a screen. When monochromatic light is used, an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes appears on the screen, confirming the wave-like behavior of light.
Key points:

    Setup: A coherent light source, such as a laser, is directed toward two narrow slits separated by a small distance.
    Wave Interference: The light waves emerging from the slits overlap, creating constructive interference (bright fringes) and destructive interference (dark fringes).
    Significance: The experiment supports the wave theory of light and is also foundational in quantum mechanics, as it highlights the dual nature of particles like photons and electrons.
